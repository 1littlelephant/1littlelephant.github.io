## U.S. Cyber Trust Mark
Two days ago, the White House announced the launch of the [U.S. Cyber Trust Mark](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/07/white-house-launches-u-s-cyber-trust-mark-providing-american-consumers-an-easy-label-to-see-if-connected-devices-are-cybersecure/), which was reported to support the American consumers that want to be sure that the "smart" appliances and computers they purchase are of high, cybersecure quality. While I very much approve of the concept, I have no idea how they would enforce such a label. 

It says that the logo will appear on wireless consumer LoT products that meet the program's cybersecurity standards, with a QR code that consumers can scan to get more information about the product and whether the security of the product is updated. They also claim that third party administrators will work to administer these qualifications. While I do not know the qualifications to get the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, I do support the initative of this program, and think it will be beneficial to consumers.
