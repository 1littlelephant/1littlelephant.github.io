## U.S. Malware Extermination

Reaction to this article: [US removes malware allegedly planted on computers by Chinese-backed hackers](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-removes-malware-allegedly-planted-computers-by-chinese-backed-hackers-2025-01-14/)

The U.S. Justice Department said on the 14th that they removed more than 4,200 infected computers of their malware, coming from China state-sponsered hackers. The malware is called "PlugX", and it was installed via USB. The U.S. and the French government have worked together to send self-removal protocols to all government infected devices.

I think this is a good reminder that we need to be careful of what we use, as even the usage of a USB stick could break computers and be used against others.
