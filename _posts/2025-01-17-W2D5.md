Reaction to this article: [Popular online bill paying site leaks data of thousands of users](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/popular-online-bill-paying-site-leaks-data-of-thousands-of-users)

This article discusses that a database hunter, Jeremiah Fowler, found an unprotected database of company "Willow Pays", including a spreadsheet with the information of 56,864 individuals. This is rough, because it shows that not all data is securely protected, and you have to be cautious with who you give your information too. 
Jeremiah Fowler reported his findings to the company, which consequently locked their database down. Despite this, it is still unknown whether the information of the users have been used maliciously or stolen before Jeremiah foound it.
