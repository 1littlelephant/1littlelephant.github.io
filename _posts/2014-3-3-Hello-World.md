## cybersecurity
I am interested in the puzzle solving aspect of cybersecurity, and also how computers are consistent. This means that it is more likely than not that you have the tools to do things, and the problem is not so much the situation you are in but your thought process. Solving such a puzzle hinges on logical thinking, rather than memorization of certain dates or commands (although I am currently still on that part).
