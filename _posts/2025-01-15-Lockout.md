## Locked out




First, we realized that Corey had changed one of the passwords on a groupmates' computer. We started by panicing, with no hope of solving this problem on our own. To start, we decided that we needed to find the target computer's IP address. To do that, we noted the IP addresses of our two working computers, and ran nmap. Despite this, we still hadn't done much research looking at nmap, so our commands did not help, nor were they efficient. We began to limit our search by trying to determine our subnet mask, finding that it was /22. 
Eventually, Evan found a working command that determined what IP addresses responded, using command "nmap -v -sn 255.255.252.0/24 10.0.140.0/22".




Ran less nmap to find the open connections on the baysplash network
Some people were on it with their macbooks so the number of online IP addresses would change
Eventually figured out which IPs belonged to the Raspberry Pis
Asked other students what IP addresses their computers were, so we could limit the suspects to 4 computers
Turned off our locked computer and ran the nmap command again to see which IP address turned off (it was 10.0.140.7)
Tried to use ssh to login to the locked computer and realized we didn’t have a password
Using process of elimination with information from the other groups, we found Corey’s (cseh-0) IP address (10.0.140.3)
Used ssh to connect to Corey (user cseh-0) with an unchanged password (security0) to ask for a hint
Found out we needed to use the program Hydra
Switched networks to guest so that we could access the internet
Installed Hydra with the command sudo apt-get install hydra-gtk
Looked up the syntax for Hydra and realized we needed a text file of common passwords
Tried to create one and realized thats not how hydra works
Used ssh to connect to Corey’s computer and got the next hint, learning that we needed to find rockyou.txt somewhere on his computer
Ran the command sudo find / -name rockyou.txt
Found it in one of his folders, tried to copy it over using scp
Wasn’t giving permission to copy over so tried to use sudo, realized that's not how it works
Ran hydra on his computer since we couldn’t transfer the files, turning him into a mini botnet
It found the password!!!
Entered the correct password for locked computer (123456)
Referenced man page for passwd command
Ran sudo passwd cseh-9
Entered previous password (123456)
Changed password back to security9
