## Level 0

**Note: I will be writing down my inputs that lead to useful information.**

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

Commands: 
```shell
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit0
```

## Level 1

**Note: In the future, I will always be starting with ssh and logging into the current bandit level, and I won't write it down to be less redundant.**

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

Commands: 
```shell
ls
cat readme
```

Found out the the password is ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If.

```shell
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
```
